Swift Post lets website administrators easily turn standard posts into powerful sponsored and branded advertising. 

== Description ==

Swift Post is a lightning fast plugin backed by a powerful ad server, making it so you can take any standard post in your feed and set dynamic controls on how it behaves. No added stress and no latency issues to your website. Plus, you’ll now have sophisticated third-party reporting and analytics that helps you make decisions you need to with new and stronger confidence.  

For example, do you have a high preforming post you would like to show again? Push the button and it’s back on the top of the feed for however many impressions you would like. If you have the same people visiting your site many times a day, simply set frequency capping which will limit how many times any given user will see that post. You can even set run dates, geotargeting, and a cap on the total impressions that post will serve for. It’s still there, it just behaves however you want because now you have more control.

With Swift Post you can turn any post into sponsored, targeted advertising capable of displaying at the top of your post list on command. In fact, it gives you the ability to display where ever you wish with the use of a convenient shortcode. Swift Post is much more than just a sticky post, a Swift Post is:

* Geotargeting
Swift Post makes it possible for you to run regionally targeted campaigns, delivering geographically relevant sponsored content that caters to local tastes. 

* Able to limit by date range & and total impressions
Swift Post lets you set a date range you want the post to serve in and the maximum number of impressions. Truly powerful content.

* Frequency Capping
This is a fancy word that means Swift Post gives you the ability to limit how often a post is seen at the top of your feed, or in the location of your choosing, by any given visitor.

* Tacked for impressions and clicks
Every Swift Post is tracked with unparalleled accuracy for impressions and clicks. Now you can see how many times a post in your feed was clicked on or viewed. 

* Split Testing
Now, with Swift Post, you can split test anything (also known as A/B testing) in order to gauge the performance of one post against another. Start maximizing the performance of your sponsored content today and find out what headlines, what messages best resonate with your visitors.

With Swift Post you get all the features you would expect from a powerful ad server right here in WordPress. Swift Post gives you the ability to sell, manage and measure on any kind of sponsored content. 

Our intuitive interface makes it super easy to setup a post, preview the post before it goes live and gather metrics on how it’s serving. Swift Post is everything you hoped post management would be.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/swiftpost` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

3. To complete the installation process you do need to register your plugin. Simply take two simple steps to create and account on http://swiftimpressions.com and you’re ready to roll and enter your license key by going to your WordPress dashboard > Swift Post > Dashboard. Once activated the status indicator in the Swift Post plugin will change from red to green.

Note: If you need help installing the plugin on your website, don’t hesitate to give our support team a call (208-473-7119) and we will gladly help. No matter what we will be here to help you! We are eager to help you with any step.

4. Go to the plugin setup screen Swift Post > Plugin Setup. This is where you decide where you want your Swift Post to display in your website feed. You have two insertion options for how each Swift Post, auto-insert and manual insertion. If you select manual insertion you have to paste the provided shortcode anywhere on your website where you would like Swift Posts to display. This option is useful if you want a Swift Post to display on a single post page or on a different location on your feed than the top. If you select auto-insert, Swift Post will default to display at the top of your feed on the front page. This option is quick, easy and preferred by most.

5. The Swift Post plugin provides you a number of options on setting how you would like your content to display. We have provided three automatic options on how the image will display and, if you would prefer, a customized display option that will aimlessly fit in with your WordPress website. The automatic options are a good way to get up and going immediately, but they won’t be a perfect match in some cases. In order to create a perfect match, you will want to click the custom content option and paste in the code your WordPress theme uses to display posts in your feed. This can be a daunting task, but don't worry, just give call (208-473-7119) and we will walk your through it step by step. If you would rather do it yourself, here is a helpful walkthrough: https://swiftimpressions.com/walkthrough/.

6. Once setup your ready to create your first Swift Post. Go create a “New Post” like normal. You’ll notice there’s a new widget on the right hand side called “Swift Post Setup.” Whether you are creating a new post or editing an existing post, this new widget will be there. Any post, new or old, can become a Swift Post.

That my friend we can help you with. Please click, here, and visit our handy-dandy walkthrough.

HOW DO I SETUP THE SWIFT AD PLUGIN?

That my friend we can help you with. Please click, here, and visit our handy-dandy walkthrough.

WHAT IS AD LANDER?

It is a technology platform for delivering ads that is immune to ad blockers. The platform also includes robust analytics and split (A/B) testing tools.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SWIFT IMPRESSIONS AND AD LANDER?

Swift Impressions is the parent company. The Swift Impressions platform was designed to give publishers much more control over what was published on their websites through ad and sponsored content networks. We built Ad Lander as an enterprise product and we have adapted it to something for mass distribution.

HOW DOES AD LANDER WORK?

Basically… The Ad Lander technology serves ad content as organic content. From an Ad Blocker perspective there is zero difference between the two and therefore it cannot block an ad. There is a little more to it than that, for example we add a transparency layer but the above is essentially still true regardless.

WHICH PRODUCTS RUN THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY?

Both Swift Post and Swift Ad run the Ad Lander technology if you are willing to pay for it. It’s worth it, and that is not a biased statement. (Jedi hand wave)

IS THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY FUTURE PROOF?

Absolutely! There is literally no programmatic method, and there never will be, that an ad blocker can utilize to understand when an Ad Lander ad is an ad. Ultimately, it’s all content and we serve it organically.

WHO OWNS THE PATNET FOR THE AD LANDER TECHNOLOGY?

Swift Impressions holds a patent-pending on the Ad Lander technology in the US. Additionally, Swift Impressions has 18 months from September 2016 to file in the UK, EU, Japan and 13 other countries. We intend to file very soon.

ARE THERE ANY LATENCY ISSUES WITH SWIFT POST?

Nope! Our tests so far have shown it to actually be faster.

DOES THE PLUGIN INCREASE MY SERVER LOAD?

Yes. There is a minor, generally manageable increase on your server load.

WHAT IS FREQUENCY CAPPING?

Frequency capping is a fancy word used by industry experts meaning the total number of times any given piece of content is viewable by any one person.

For example, if you create a Swift Post and set the frequency capping to 3, the maximum number of times any given user will be able to see that post is 3 separate times. After that, it will be placed back to it’s normal place in your feed.

WHAT ARE IMPRESSIONS?

Impressions are how many times a piece of content has been viewed.

WHAT IS MEANT BY GEO TARGETING?

Geo targeting refers the ability to place restrictions a post in a manner that only certain visitors from any given location or locations will be able to see it.

For example, if an advertiser would like to run a sponsored post on your site for a wedding expo in Colorado. I doesn’t make sense for the advertiser to pay for the impressions coming for visitors in New York.

Geo targeting allows for highly targeted and effects advertising.
